## Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as
you are working:

## Formatting



## Development Guidelines

When starting a new task you should always create a new branch, based of the
**`master`** branch which should be `<type>/<subject>` with one of the
following types:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **chore**: A new chore
- **fix**: A branch that fixes a bug

## Git Commit Guidelines

The following workflow is used: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

Each commit message consists of `<type> : <subject>` with the following types.

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
  formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such
  as documentation generation
- **revert**: Reverts a specific commit

## Pull Request

When you finish a task you should setup a pull request and fill out the pull
request template.
